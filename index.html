<div><p>If you jump a turnstile or enter the subway through an exit gate, and fail to provide payment for a ride fare you can get a $100 fine. Since 2017 until the third quarter of 2022, 202,788 summons have been given to subway fare evaders. Only 7% of fare evaders have been arrested for doing so, but Hispanic and Black people represent more than 86% of the arrests every year. 
<br>
<br>
In total, more than 72,907 summons have been served to Black people. The amount of Hispanic people to have been ordered to appear in court is more than 68,807. 
<br>
<br>
According to quarterly reports by the NYPD, in 2018 more than 2,951 Black, and 1,569 Hispanic people were arrested for theft of services. Compared to a total of 355 White, and 96 Asian/Pacific Islanders people that year.

New York City Mayor Eric Adams and Governor Kathy Hochul set forth in October the expansion of initiatives to New York City subways safety and address transit crime as part of the <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/087-22/mayor-adams-releases-subway-safety-plan-says-safe-subway-prerequisite-new-york-city-s#/0">Subway Safety Plan</a> announced earlier in the year. This means a collaboration between the MTA and the New York Police Department (NYPD) to address crime, including fare evasion and includes a surge of officer presence on platforms and trains under the <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-and-mayor-adams-announce-major-actions-keep-subways-safe-and-address-transit">“Cops, Cameras, Care”</a> initiative. This will add 1,200 extra overtime shifts daily to watch over the subway system. "My number one priority as Governor is keeping New Yorkers safe in the streets, in their homes, in their schools, and on the subway, and we will do whatever it takes to make our subways safer for riders," Governor Hochul said during the announcement.
